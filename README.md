ML Interpretability Study

An HTML-based smart online quiz, powered by Firebase, and utilizing jQuery.

Our purpose is to study how different machine learning interpretability and representation modules impact users' comprehension and comfort 
  with using various ML models.
The quiz utilizes a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to select a sequence of questions to present out of multiple possibilities,
  in a solution to a multi-armed bandits type model.
